# The Strength of Reading Machines

## Written by: Gavin Kirk

	Reading machines to some might just be a E-reader or Apples Siri announcing your most recent text that has just come in but to scholars it is something much more complex. In Stephen Ramsays article Reading Machines he explains the origin and use of reading machines specifically in the digital humanities field. Matthew Kirschenbaum would say that the “digital humanities [have] accumulated a robust professional apparatus that is probably more rooted in English than any other departmental home.”(Kirschenbaum, 2012) I would disagree with him. I believe the digital humanities are beyond just the English department. Matt Schneider would agree too as he explains “the general sense of the digital humanities is still that it has more in common with the social sciences and computer sciences than the humanities, a sense that is apparent in popular articles like Fish’s blog posts (2012a,2012b) and Kathryn Schulz’s New York Times article “What is Distant Reading” (2011), and can even be felt to some degree when Johanna Drucker separates the digital humanities from speculative computing (2009 4-5).”(Schneider, 2012) Ramsays explanation of reading machines aka computational text analysis can be used beyond the English departments. The power of digital tools can be seen in Voyant, on their man website they pride themselves on the team work and ability to share your work with others. This is something Kirschenbaum explains in his paper that the digital humanities are built on collaboration and having tools that allow for collaboration are important. Text analysis tools can be used in a variety of fields they can be used critically and they can be shared. Below is an image the most found words in Voyants example gallery for their tool. This gallery is where people can share how they used Voyant.

Looking at the picture we see a variety of words and some of the most important are blog, digital humanities, and university. These are 3 vary important roles for Voyant and all text analysis tools.
Blog is a place to share work and communicate with others in the field. To head and critic others and their posts much like this blog will be critiqued. This collaboration through digital tools is impactful in studies and is an easy way to share and communicate the data you have collected. 
Digital Humanities is another key area where text analysis tools are being used and it makes sense. In a discipline developed for words and that functions through them, it only makes sense that analysis these words would add to the field of study. The digital humanities field is just so vast that the tool can impact so many different areas. It’s used in data construction, data mining, social and computer sciences. It wouldn’t surprise me if it was used more in science and math writing as well to understand large sections of data quickly. 
Universities is one of the other keywords and that shows that people are either writing about universities, for universities, or with universities. These are all essential for developing a tool and using a tool effectively and in areas of importance. To see that Voyants being used for these variety of purposes suggests that the digital tools used for text analysis are important and can be used to support finds or provide initial research to build upon. 
Text analysis software are a power tools that Ramsay wanted share with us after their beginning with Roberto Busa a Jesuit priest in the late 1940s. It’s important to understand and continue to use text analysis software in a variety of ways to constantly improve different disciplines and how they function. Conducting research and establishing different findings are part of every academic venture and must continue to evolve.
