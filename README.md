# IASC-2P02  Gavin Kirk



## About Me

My name is Gavin Kirk I am a third year Brock Interactive Arts and Science(IASC) student at Brock University. The IASC program is broken down into different streams and my focus has been on Digital Expression. My passion leans towards 3D modeling and after participating in a intership with a motion capture company I have started to direct my studies in that direction as well. I am also part of the Brock Badgers mens Ultimate Frisbee Team which has been a great experience and something I like to do to unwind. In my spare time I will often play games on my pc at home or spend time with friends and family.
